        <p class="paragraph">My hobbies are pretty common, including playing video games, reading, watching shows and moives, and listening to music. I like to believe I have a broad taste in music, though there are many much more well versed in it than me. I want to broaden my horizons in all matters, whether it be music or even places to live as I believe that new experiences are fantastic ways to grow as a person.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">My accomplishments include limited (but growing) experience in Python, some experience in Java and, as you can tell, HTML and CSS. I have been certified in data analytics, and I've also gone to the state level competition for BPA. As I'm still in school I'll be planning on attending Delta college in Bay City, Michigan. I believe that when I passionate about my work I can succeed and even excel in those fields. As for my dedication I feel as though it matches, or even exceeds that of my peers.</p>
